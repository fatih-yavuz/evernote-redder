## What?
This script **only** wraps the content of a **html** source from the clipboard with a span with color style    

## Why the hell?

Well... The problem is, there is no shortcut to change color of selected text to a color for EverNote on MacOS

I've tried to make an Alfred workflow but Alfred removes the styles of selected text when copied into clipboard.

### What about Keyboard Maestro?
Glad you asked! I am actually calling this script from Keyboard Maestro macro.

#### Why the hell? x2
You are now asking, wouldn't `Apply Style to Clipboard` be enough?
It works for majority of the apps, for example Google Docs but `Apply Style to Clipboard` styles the content and saves it as `rtf`. Unfortunately EverNote accepts `html` content.

## What would I do with this 9 lines of script?  
The script is probably useless for you.
I was just hoping you would find answer for why you were failing to change the color of selected text via Alfred workflow or Keyboard Maestro and give me a star :)
